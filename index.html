        <h2>Welcome Barclay to the Horizon Zoo</h2>
        <p>Posted by Joseph Summers, Zoo Director</p>
        <p>January 28, 20XX</p>
        <br>
        <p>We're very excited to welcome a wonderful little animal to our Zoo family. His name is Barclay and he is a fennec fox. Barclay boasts enormous ears, a tiny nose, reddish cream fur, and jet-black eyes. He was brought to the zoo by a private owner who found he could no longer care for him.</p>
        <img src="Images/FlickrImages/Fennec.jpg" class="fox" alt="Fennec">
        <p>The fennec fox is the smallest fox in the world, weighing two to three pounds and approximately 9 to 16 inches in length. They have oversized ears, nearly half the size of their body. Their ears help them to hear their prey underground. They also regulate their body temperature and keep them cool.</p>
        <p>They can be found in the Sahara Desert and in the deserts of Northern Africa and Northern Sinai. They have thick fur which keeps them warm during frigid cold nights and protects them from the heat of the day within their desert environment. Even the fox's feet are hairy, which helps them perform like snowshoes and protects them from extremely hot sand. The fox's feet are also effective shovels for frequent digging.</p>
        <p>Humans are an predator of the fennec fox. The animals are trapped and sold into the pet trade or even hunted for their lush fur. Large predators such as birds of prey or hyenas could catch them if the foxes journey outside the burrow, so staying inside during the day is sensible for this little creature. Their heat-reflecting coat also provides excellent camouflage in their surroundings.</p>
        <p>You can visit Barclay at the African Exhibit. Visit our Adopt page to learn how you can adopt our new fennec fox and help contribute to the survival of this species.</p>
